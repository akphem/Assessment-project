              The free assessment is designed to help participants identify
              their emotional states and their relative positions. It addresses
              those who are overwhelmed by emotions and aware of feelings, but
              struggle to differentiate, understand, or appropriately respond to
              various emotions.

                "The author, having completed two master's research degrees on
                emotional intelligence in Nigeria and England receptively, is
                now pursuing a PhD on the cutting-edge intersection between
                emotional and spiritual intelligences in Paris, France. As a
                certified Complementary Therapist and Accredited Association
                (CTAA) member, the author brings a unique perspective to this
                research. This study seeks to illuminate how these
                often-overlooked facets of human experience influence
                decision-making, interpersonal dynamics, and organizational
                outcomes. Emotional and spiritual intelligences are crucial in
                everyday life, shaping interactions in relationships, families,
                organizations, and communities. They are also essential for
                maintaining a healthy mental, emotional, physical, and
                psychological lifestyle."
                <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-950">Authorâ€™s recommendation:</h1>
                The author recommends regularly taking emotional intelligence
                assessments to enhance and develop your emotional intelligence
                skills.
